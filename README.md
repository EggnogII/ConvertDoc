# ConvertDoc

## Description
Python program utilizing Pypandoc to convert documents from Markdown to DocX and vice versa.

## Why

I found sometimes it would be nice to convert something from Markdown to Word and vice versa without having to go online and look at any particular "converters" for said documents.

## Todo?

* Support for non-Word based editors
* Support for Previews possibly
* Possible docgen to scan code and create documentation (probably an AI solution but I'm not sure if/when I'll get around to it)
